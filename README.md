======================

Madelen Tzoanidis Custom Post type + widget f√∂r Ynnor. 

This is my first Custom Post Type to WordPress, which is similar to WordPress's own "post", plus a widget that shows X number of posts that have been made in Custom Post Type, and how many posts too list are selected by the user in the widget panel. The widget will then display a list of the posts, with picture (if there is one), title and date they were written. The posts are sorted by date, last written post comes first.
